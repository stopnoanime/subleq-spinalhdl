# Subleq Spinalhdl
 Subleq OISC made in SpinalHDL. It has 16 Bit word width and 64KB of RAM. Serial I/O works using the -1 address.

 You can program it using the [Higher Subleq](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Higher_Subleq) language. After compiling a program into a .sq file you can use sq_to_bin to convert it to a file used by the FPGA. This repo comes with few example programs.
